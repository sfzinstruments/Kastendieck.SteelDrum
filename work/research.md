The steel drum samples were recorded by M. Kastendieck.
This is likely Mary Kastendieck who is a known steel drums player in the group
["Pans on the Prairie"](http://www.stpetersucc.us/pans/potp/aboutme.htm).
The site was last updated in 2004, and Mary's e-mail address is
maryk@pansontheprairie.com. My guess is the band is no longer in existance.
Mary appears to be a middle-aged woman in the photo.
